Tiffin Services Platform Using JSP
Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to facilitate Tiffin (or Tiffine) services. Tiffin services involve providing home-cooked meals delivered to customers, typically in a subscription model. The platform is built using JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java, providing a dynamic and scalable solution for managing Tiffin orders, deliveries, and customer interactions.

Features
User Registration and Login: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
Menu Management: Admins can create, update, and delete menu items, including descriptions and prices.
Order Placement: Customers can browse the menu, place orders, and manage their subscriptions.
Order Tracking: Users can track the status of their orders in real-time.
Admin Dashboard: Admins can view and manage orders, user accounts, and other critical system functions.
Customer Feedback: Users can leave feedback on meals and service quality.
Technology Stack
Java: Used for server-side logic and application functionality.
JSP (JavaServer Pages): Provides the dynamic presentation layer of the application.
Servlets: Handle HTTP requests and responses, working alongside JSP to manage application flow.
JDBC: Connects to a database for data persistence, including user information, menu items, and orders.
